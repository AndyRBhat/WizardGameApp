## 📖 About the Project

**Wizard Survival** is an interactive 2D game where players control a wizard to dodge incoming enemies and survive against the clock.

I built this project to practice **Event-Driven Programming** and **Python Logic**. Unlike standard Python scripts that run in a terminal, this project runs in the browser using **Pyodide**, allowing me to write Python code that controls web elements in real-time.

### 🎯 Learning Goals
This project helped me deepen my understanding of:
* **WebAssembly:** Running compiled Python code in the browser without a backend server.
* **Event-Driven Programming:** Handling user inputs and game loops asynchronously.
* **Algorithm Design:** Creating difficulty scaling that reacts to the game timer.

## 🎮 How to Play

* **Objective:** Survive for **135 seconds** without letting your health drop to zero.
* **Mechanics:** Enemies spawn at increasing rates as the timer counts down. Colliding with enemies reduces health.

### 🕹️ Controls

| Key | Action |
| :---: | :--- |
| **W** | Move Up ⬆️ |
| **A** | Move Left ⬅️ |
| **S** | Move Down ⬇️ |
| **D** | Move Right ➡️ |

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

This project utilizes a custom architecture to execute Python in the browser.

### 1. Game Logic (My Contribution)
The core gameplay resides in `program.py`, which I wrote to implement the game mechanics.
* **State Management:** Tracking variables for health, timer, and coordinate positions (`x`, `y`).
* **Game Loop:** Implementing the `countdown()` and enemy spawning logic using interval timers.
* **Collision Logic:** Defining how the wizard interacts with enemies.
* **Input Handling:** Binding keyboard events to coordinate updates.
* **Algorithm Design:** Creating logic that increases enemy spawn rates as the timer decreases (difficulty scaling).

### 2. The Engine (Pyodide & JavaScript)
The application relies on `pyodide.js` to load the Python runtime.
* **`button_config.js`**: Fetches the raw Python code and writes it to Pyodide's virtual filesystem. It captures browser events to initialize the game loop.
* **`mylibrary.py` (Helper Tool)**: To facilitate interaction with the HTML DOM, I utilized a helper library that abstracts low-level JS operations. It handles creating HTML elements, CSS transformations, and managing `setTimeout`/`setInterval`.

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

Because this project uses WebAssembly, browsers will block it if you try to open `index.html` directly from your file explorer due to **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)** policies. You must run a local server to play it.

### Option 1: Using Visual Studio Code (Recommended)
This is the easiest method if you are using VS Code.

1.  **Install the "Live Server" Extension:**
    * Open VS Code and click the Extensions icon on the left sidebar.
    * Search for **"Live Server"** (by Ritwick Dey) and install it.
2.  **Open the Project:**
    * Open the `wizard-survival` folder in VS Code.
3.  **Launch the Game:**
    * Right-click on `index.html` in the file explorer.
    * Select **"Open with Live Server"**.
    * Your default browser will open automatically and the game will load.

> **⚠️ Note on "Missing Import" Errors:**
> When viewing the code in VS Code, you may see red error squiggles under lines like `from js import document` or `from pyodide import ...`.
> * **This is normal.** These libraries only exist inside the web browser's runtime (Pyodide).
> * Your local Python linter (Pylance) cannot see them, but the code will run perfectly in the browser.

### Option 2: Using Python Terminal
If you prefer the command line or don't use VS Code:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/wizard-survival.git](https://github.com/yourusername/wizard-survival.git)
    cd wizard-survival
    ```
2.  **Start the server:**
    ```bash
    python -m http.server
    ```
3.  **Open the Game:**
    * Visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
